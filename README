I recommend using GNU stow for managing config files.

Instructions:

  $ stow -t $HOME -S home
  $ sudo stow -t /etc  -S etc

Stow will never delete any file it doesn't own so in order to replace those,
you can either adopt (-a flag) your own into the package or remove those first.
Exceptions are clear to inform the user of what would've happened.

  $ stow -t /etc/ -S etc
  WARNING! stowing etc would cause conflicts:
    * existing target is neither a link nor a directory: environment
    * existing target is neither a link nor a directory: vconsole.conf
